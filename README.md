Hi there, I'm @abrinkman. I'm a cloud architect with a lot of experience in IT infrastructure, Linux and open source software stacks. In my daily work I'm involved in AWS, serverless and networking projects, building CI/CD and automation workflows and designing complex hosting solutions. See https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexanderbrinkman/.
In my spare time I like to experiment with new technologies and home automation (currently Home Assistant).
